  [Tesseract GitHub repository](https://github.com/UB-Mannheim/tesseract/wiki)

### Add Tesseract to PATH

  ```powershell
  tesseract --version
  ```

## Import file from source code directory

In this project, we are adding __init__.py in order to package the source code in one package inorder to import it easily at any other py file.

### Step 1: Modify the Project Structure

You need to add an `__init__.py` file to the `src` directory so that Python will treat it as a package.

### Step 2: Modify the Import Statements

```python
from chatGPT import gpt_utils

gpt_utils.test_connection()
```

## Install ffmpeg for play audio function from eleven labs

```python
from elevenlabs import generate, play

audio = generate(text, voice="DPsqCHWEBVTyO9962K8u")
play(audio)
```

1. Download the appropriate version for Windows ([Go to the FFmpeg Download Page](https://github.com/BtbN/FFmpeg-Builds/releases)
).

2. Extract the files to a directory (e.g., C:\ffmpeg). And add ffmpeg to the System Path.

3. Verify Installation:
